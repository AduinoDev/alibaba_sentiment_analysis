# alibaba_sentiment_analysis using naive bayes clasifier, logistic regretion, SVM, decision tree clasification, random forest classification, and stochastic gradient decent, to classify positive and negative tweets. 
Twitter data was collected using twitter API with tweepy python package.
Analyze the suitability of various approaches to NLP sentiment analysis by comparing the performance of the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Maximum Entropy Classifier and Support Vector Machines. We notice that feature selection technique has a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm. The presence of trigram and bigram information produced better results with all the three algorithms compared to unigrams. This is attributed to the fact that trigrams and bigrams are better at capturing sentiment patterns unlike unigrams which just provide a good coverage of the data. Trigrams achieved an overally higher performance in all instances giving an accuracy of 82.6% with unigrams achieving the least accuracy of 73.8%. However, as statements became long and winded with contradictory phrases, the classifiers performed poorly. This means therefore, that feature selection method alone is not enough to determine the performance of an algorithm. Some advanced NLP techniques might be required to deal with this shortcoming.
